# AtmFrontEnd-HTML
#This is the THML frontEnd for an ATM transaction
#In this case you will have to put your ID(account number and the amount you want to deposit)to each of the account in your Bank.
#It should save you inputs to the database and link with the ATM transaction backEnd but not yet, it is not linking for now.
#It is a very usable ATM transaction ever and will help everyone even if you are old Age.
